# Bath's Static Webpages

## [Homepage](https://bathinjan.github.io/home/)
My homepage. Uses HTML/CSS only - no javascript. Functions as a resume and portfolio page.

Currently a work in progress.

## [Simple Analogue Clock](https://bathinjan.github.io/Clocks/)
My first HTML / CSS Project. Displays a simple analogue clock with event button that changes the clock from 12 to 24 hour format.

## [Dad Joke Generator](https://bathinjan.github.io/dadjokegenerator/)
My first webpage using a REST API: grabs a Dad Joke and displays it after an event button is clicked.

Currently little styling is done with CSS: work in progress.
